# shulk-spammer

The shulk spammer is a spam bot designed for the anarchy minecraft server [6b6t](https://6b6t.com). The spammer uses mineflayer to put a bot on the server and send messages every few seconds. Note, this bot requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) in order to function. This is not a tutorial to download it, go find one somewhere else.
